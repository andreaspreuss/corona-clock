## The Corona Clock

This was really just a quick hack to make a graphical timepiece for my son, who doesn't tell time yet, but who wanted to know when he needed to play alone and when he could play with his parents during a prolonged stay-at-home, work-at-home period.  

If you've looked at other IoT projects and thought "too complicated", well this is just what you're looking for.  It doesn't do much, but it did exactly what we needed.

I ended up [writing it up for Hackaday](https://wp.me/paBn4l-1H3H), which is probably why you're here.  Enjoy!
